# P422 Project (REPLACE ME)

Here, you should put your project proposal. It should be written in english text and describe what you intend to build along with any information necessary. Please use proper markdown formatting. You can find a guide here: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Your project should have the following requirements met:

* A server side component written with javascript that stores information in a database
* A client side component written in Angular
* At least four different interactive views for the client

You may choose whatever kid of project you like within the ethical guidlines of the university. Commit your propasal to this file and we will discuss your project idea if it needs improvement.

## TODO

1. Replace this readme file with a description of your project.
2. Write a server and client application and store each in this project. I recommend creating subdirectories for each, something like server/ and client/. Each should have their own package.json.
3. Commit often. This main branch will be the graded content.
